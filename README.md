## The Problem

We all save content constantly — Instagram posts, YouTube videos, Reddit threads, articles, recipes — but every platform buries it in its own silo:

- **Instagram Saved** is a graveyard. No search, no categories, no reminders. You save hundreds of posts and never look at them again.
- **YouTube Watch Later** piles up endlessly with no way to know what each video was about without rewatching it.
- **Browser bookmarks** are a mess — unsorted folders full of dead links and forgotten context.
- **Screenshots** fill your gallery with no searchable text.

You spend time saving things you'll never find again. You forget **what** you saved, **why** you saved it, and **where** you saved it.

## The Solution

**SuperBrain** is a self-hosted Android app + Python backend that acts as your **personal AI-powered content archive**. Share any URL from any app — the backend analyses it with AI in seconds and gives you:

- A clean **title** and **summary** so you instantly know what it's about
- Auto-assigned **category** and **tags** for filtering at a glance
- **Background music identification** from Instagram reels (via Shazam)
- **Audio transcription** from videos (Groq Whisper API + local Whisper)
- Smart **Watch Later reminders** that actually bring you back to your content

Everything is stored in a local SQLite database **you own** — no cloud subscriptions, no data harvesting, no vendor lock-in.

## AI Model Router

Free AI APIs have rate limits, downtime, and variable speed. SuperBrain solves this with a **multi-provider model router** that automatically selects the fastest available model and falls back transparently on failure — you never have to think about which provider is working.

### Priority Chain

| Task | Fallback Order |
|---|---|
| **Text analysis** | Groq → Gemini → OpenRouter (hardcoded best) → Dynamic free OpenRouter → Ollama |
| **Vision** | Gemini → Groq Vision → OpenRouter Vision → Ollama Vision |
| **Transcription** | Groq Whisper API → Local OpenAI Whisper |
| **YouTube** | Gemini (native URL understanding) |

### How It Works

- **Performance ranking** — tracks response times with an exponential moving average; faster models get promoted automatically
- **Cooldown on failure** — generic errors trigger a 5‑minute cooldown; rate limits (HTTP 429) trigger a 30‑minute cooldown
- **Dynamic discovery** — refreshes the OpenRouter free model list every 6 hours, scores models by context length, capabilities, recency, and provider trust
- **Persistent rankings** — saved to `config/model_rankings.json` so performance data survives server restarts

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Key in `config/.api_keys` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Groq** | `GROQ_API_KEY` | Fastest inference — free tier at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |
| **Google Gemini** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Most generous free tier at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) |
| **OpenRouter** | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Free model router at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) |
| **Ollama** | *(no key needed)* | Local inference — `start.py` guides setup · recommended model: `qwen3-vl:4b` |

> **Tip:** You don't need all providers — the router falls back automatically. Start with at least **Gemini** (most generous free tier). Ollama serves as the fully offline last resort.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup Prerequisites

| Requirement | Install | Needed For |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.10+ | [python.org](https://python.org) | npm + local Python setup |
| ffmpeg | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` / `brew install ffmpeg` / `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` | all backend methods |
| Node.js 20+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) | npm one-line setup |
| Docker + Compose | [docs.docker.com/get-started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) | Docker setup |
| ngrok (optional) | [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) | phone access from outside local network |

### Method 1: npm One-Line Setup (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run backend on any PC without cloning this repository.

```bash
# Run directly (no global install)
npx -y superbrain-server@latest
```

Optional global install:

```bash
npm install -g superbrain-server
superbrain-server
```

What this does on first run:

1. Downloads backend package to `~/.superbrain-server`
2. Creates virtual environment
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs interactive setup wizard
5. Starts API server and prints Access Token

Useful commands:

```bash
superbrain-server               # Starts the backend engine
superbrain-server status        # Show connection QR code & running server info
superbrain-server update        # Update the backend components
superbrain-server ngrok         # Configure Ngrok tunnel
superbrain-server reset         # Open interactive reset menu
superbrain-server reset --all   # Force complete data wipe
```

### Method 2: Docker Setup

Use this when you want containerized, reproducible deployment.

```bash
cd superbrain/backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at least:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (recommended)
- `GROQ_API_KEY` (optional)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (optional)

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f superbrain-api
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Method 3: Local Python Setup (Normal)

Use this when developing backend locally without Docker.

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd superbrain\backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start.py
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
cd superbrain/backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start.py
```

Direct API run (without setup wizard):

```bash
python api.py
```

### Connect Android App to Backend

1. Start backend using any method above.
2. Copy the Access Token shown by backend.
3. In Android app Settings, set backend URL and Access Token.
4. Verify `/health` endpoint returns OK.

### Optional: Expose Backend for Phone Access

If phone cannot reach your PC directly, expose port 5000:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Use the generated HTTPS URL in app Settings.

> **Tip:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is accepted as a compatibility alias, but `GEMINI_API_KEY` is the preferred key name.

---

## Packages

SuperBrain backend launcher is published in two registries:

- npmjs: [superbrain-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superbrain-server)
  - Stable install: `npx -y superbrain-server@latest`

- GitHub Packages: `@sidinsearch/superbrain-server`
  - One-time auth + install block (`read:packages` token required):
  - Note: only needed for GitHub Packages. Not needed for npmjs (`superbrain-server`) installs.

```bash
npm config set @sidinsearch:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
npx -y @sidinsearch/superbrain-server@latest

```

GitHub Packages docs: [Working with the npm registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry)

GitHub Packages is separate from the npmjs package page and may not appear in the repository Packages tab until it has been published and linked there.

## Instagram Credentials

SuperBrain uses [Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/) to download Instagram posts. It can operate in two modes:

### Without credentials (anonymous mode)

SuperBrain works **without any Instagram account** — but with limitations:

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **Public posts only** | Only posts from public profiles that Instagram serves to unauthenticated users |
| **Rate limiting** | Instagram aggressively rate-limits anonymous requests — you may need to wait several minutes between saves |
| **Login-required blocks** | Some posts trigger a `LoginRequiredException` even if the profile is public — these get auto-queued for retry later |

YouTube videos and web pages are **not affected** — they work fully without Instagram credentials.

### With credentials (recommended)

Adding Instagram credentials removes all the above restrictions:

- ✅ **Reliable downloads** — authenticated sessions are not rate-limited for normal usage
- ✅ **Access to all public posts** — no more login-required blocks
- ✅ **Posts from followed private accounts** — if the authenticated account follows a private profile, those posts can be saved too
- ✅ **Session caching** — you log in once and the session is reused automatically until Instagram invalidates it

### How to set up

**Option 1 — During setup wizard** (recommended)

`start.py` prompts for Instagram credentials during first-run setup. Enter your username and password when asked — they're saved to `config/.api_keys` and a session file is created automatically.

**Option 2 — Manual login**

```bash
cd superbrain/backend
python instagram/instagram_login.py
```

This interactive script handles the full login flow including **two-factor authentication (2FA)**. It saves:
- Credentials → `config/.api_keys` (gitignored)
- Session → `.instaloader_session` (gitignored)

### ⚠️ Security advice

> **Use a secondary / burner Instagram account — not your main personal account.**
>
> While credentials are stored locally and never transmitted anywhere other than Instagram's servers, using a disposable account protects your primary account from any risk of rate-limit flags or session issues.

Credentials are stored in `config/.api_keys` which is **gitignored** — they will never be committed to version control. The cached session file (`.instaloader_session`) is also gitignored.

---

## Installing the Android App

### Option 1 — Download from Releases *(easiest)*

The latest APK is always available on the **[Releases](https://github.com/sidinsearch/superbrain/releases)** page.

1. Download `superbrain.apk` from the latest release
2. On your Android device, enable **Install from unknown sources**
3. Open the APK to install

### Option 2 — EAS Cloud Build

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
cd superbrain-app
eas build --platform android --profile preview --non-interactive
```

EAS returns a download URL + QR code when done. No Android Studio required.

### Option 3 — GitHub Actions

The repo includes:

- [build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml): On push to `main`, it builds APK, uploads artifact, publishes the GitHub npm package, and updates the release with `superbrain.apk`
- [release APK workflow](.github/workflows/release-apk.yml): Optional tag/release-driven APK pipeline for versioned tags

Automatic release targets:

1. Push to `main` updates release tag `latest` (stable).


How to get the newest APK from Actions artifacts:

1. Push your changes to `main`.
2. Open **GitHub → Actions → Build APK (Gradle)**.
3. Open the latest successful run.
4. Download the artifact named like `superbrain-release-<run_number>`.
5. Extract it and rename `superbrain.apk` if needed.
6. Use it directly for testing/internal sharing.

### Option 4 — Local Gradle Build

```bash
cd superbrain-app
npm install
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## Release Process

Use this push-based flow to keep GitHub release + APK + GitHub Packages aligned.

1. Push changes to `main`.
2. `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs automatically and does all of the following:
  - Builds release APK.
  - Uploads APK as an Actions artifact.
  - Updates the branch release and attaches `superbrain.apk`.
  - Publishes `@sidinsearch/superbrain-server` to GitHub Packages.
3. Verify:
  - APK download works from the release.
  - Package appears under GitHub Packages for the repository.

Recommended release notes install line:

```bash
npx -y superbrain-server@latest
```

Verification checklist:

1. `latest` (main) release contains `superbrain.apk`.
2. Repository **Packages** tab shows `@sidinsearch/superbrain-server`.
3. Install checks:
  - npmjs: `npx -y superbrain-server@latest`
  - GitHub Packages: `npx -y @sidinsearch/superbrain-server@latest`

## Hosting Options

The backend is lightweight and runs anywhere with Python 3.10+:

| Platform | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Your PC / laptop** | Free | Use ngrok to expose · disable sleep / hibernate |
| **Raspberry Pi** | ~$50 one-time | Low power, always-on home server |
| **AWS EC2** | Free tier | `t2.micro` handles it fine |
| **DigitalOcean** | $4/mo | Basic droplet |
| **Hetzner** | €3.29/mo | Fast EU-based VPS |
| **Google Cloud Run** | Pay-per-use | Serverless, scales to zero |

For cloud hosting, open port `5000` in your firewall and point the app directly at your server's public IP — no ngrok needed.

---

## Notifications

SuperBrain uses Android notification channels to keep you engaged with your saved content without being noisy.

### Watch Later

Adding a post to the **Watch Later** collection triggers:

| Notification | When | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Instant confirmation** | Immediately | High-priority heads-up banner |
| **Daily reminder** | Once per day, unique time slot per post | Spread between 8:00 AM – 9:30 PM |
| **Urgent morning alert** | 9:00 AM | Only for deadline-sensitive content (exams, hackathons, applications) |

Each reminder includes a **Mark as Watched** action button — tap it to remove from Watch Later and cancel all future reminders for that post.

### Other Collections

Saving to any non-Watch Later collection fires an instant **"Saved to SuperBrain"** notification confirming the save.
